# Unnamed New Tab Extension

Codename: Exhaust fumes

This extension is simple:

- Displays an image in the new tab
- You can choose the opacity and background color
- For now, that's it really.

It's also pretty horribly styled at the moment, but that is subject to change.

## Building

idfk a million, it's built on React and random code off the web. I'll garuantee one thing, it doesn't spy on you - which was half the reason why I decided to make it.
