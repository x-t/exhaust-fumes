# After Dark in CSS

![Flying Toasters in CSS](img/flying-toasters-css.jpg)

Do you longingly reminisce about the days when flying toasters graced your screen? Do words like "Confetti Factory" and "Daredevil Dan" make your heart skip a beat?

If so, then never fear—CSS is here! Using modern CSS techniques like animations and transforms, we can imitate several of your favorite After Dark™ screensavers.

The animations were made with CSS alone. No animated gifs or JavaScript.
